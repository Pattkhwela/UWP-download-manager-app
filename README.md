# UWP Download manager app 

## This is a download manager for the UWP platform written in C#.net and XAML markup.

The purpose of this project is to create a download manager that can work on all Windows 10 device form factors. The flexibility of the UWP code base allows this to be possible. The app was developed with a mobile first design approach and will be further integrated into a desktop and Xbox UI/UX layout in future versions. 



## This app will work in Visual Studio 2015 or later and requires the Windows 10 TH2 SDK or later to work.

I plan on deploying this software to the Windows App store in the future and allow regular people to have access to this app.
